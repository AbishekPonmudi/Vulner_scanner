The Scanner which scan you device and show the possible vunerbility and you device status which collect the information which is usefull for the vulnerbility assesser , and security assesser , little more like me , which give the informatiuon of the status of the firewall status ,port status , kernal status , and device info and this is work for both windows and unix based systems , but not for macos will be updated later.
  

While linux and windows is generally considered secure but in some condition which cause vulnerable , scanning using this script will really ensure the system secure !
